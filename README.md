## üìö Project Overview

This platform currently:
- Streams real-time financial market data using a Kafka **producer**.
- Processes streaming data using a Spark Structured Streaming **consumer**.
- Stores processed data into a **ClickHouse** database.
- Runs fully containerized with **Docker Compose**.

Upcoming features:
- Scraping latest **financial news**.
- Extracting **historical market data**.
- **DBT** (Data Build Tool) transformations for cleaned, modeled datasets.
- **Grafana** dashboards for data visualization.
- **Machine Learning** to detect price anomalies.
- **Alerting** systems via email or Slack for market events.
